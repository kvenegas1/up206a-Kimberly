## UP206A: Introduction to GIS and Spatial Data Science :world_map: <h2> 

**Course description:**
This course will teach students various data science tools, and the basics of programming with Python. Students will learn spatial analysis through Python Libraries and through advanced geoprocessing. All lessons will be based on “real” data and will address relevant and contemporary urban problems. By the end of the course, students will be able to critically describe, analyze, and visualize spatial data for planning practices and research.


**Project ideas:**
I am interested in analyzing the how accesible public transit is for affordable housing in Los Angeles. 
I would also be curious to know which Los Angeles streets have the most accidents and whether they are in low income areas


**Objectives for the class:**
I want to learn to effectively use python to create maps I can use in my reports. I also want to learn where I can find different types of data and how to integrate it into my work.
