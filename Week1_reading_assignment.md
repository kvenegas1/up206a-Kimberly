[Mapping the Effects of Shelter-in-Place on Traffic Congestion by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority](https://www.sfcta.org/blogs/mapping-effects-shelter-place-traffic-congestion)

This article introduces the public to the Transportation Authority's COVID-Era Congestion Tracker. Although congestion decreased dramatically during the first months of shelter-in-place, congestion has began rising again. The Transportation Authority created this tracker to not only inform the public of rising congestion levels, but to also inform SFMTA's transportation recovery plan, support Vision Zero safety efforts, and help the city monitor the effects of Slow Streets.   The tracker uses speed data collected by Inrix, which monitors traffic data. The map uses different color vectors to show how congested a street or highway is. People can choose to view the speed data from the morning or evening. Also, people can decide to view absolute speeds or a comparison with pre-COVID conditions. 

This blog spoke to me because it demonstrates a scenario in which it is best to present data in a map format. Instead of throwing a bunch of numbers at people about traffic changes, the Transportation Authority created a map that is easy to understand and that allows people to look at specific areas of interest. The map is also a great way to show changes over time. I hope that when I am transportation planner I am able to create maps like this one so that I can present data in a way that is clear and helpful.

Then,
write a paragraph (yes, a paragraph, not two) that summarizes the article. Write a second
paragraph where you reflect critically and creatively about the material in your own words.
Why did this article speak to you in regards to your approach to data and research? How
does it inform you own data science goals?
