[Mapping the Effects of Shelter-in-Place on Traffic Congestion by the San Francisco County Transportation Authority](https://www.sfcta.org/blogs/mapping-effects-shelter-place-traffic-congestion)

This article introduces the public to the Transportation Authority's COVID-Era Congestion Tracker. The tracker uses speed data collected by Inrix which monitors traffic data. The map uses different colors to show how congested a street or highway is. People can choose to view the speed data from the morning or evening. Also, people can decide to choose to view absolute speeds or a comparison with pre-COVID conditions. The Transportation Authority created this tracker to not only inform the public of rising congestion levels but also inform SFMTA's transportation recovery plan, support Vision Zero safety efforts, and help the city monitor the effects of Slow Streets
